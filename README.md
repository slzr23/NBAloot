# NBAloot
Here is the description of my NFT's project named 'NBA loot'.

This project is made by SLZR.

The goal of the project is to collect more as possible cards to have the rarests NBA players. 
You have 3 types of players: common: 85% of chance of spawn/rare: 18% of chance of spawn/ and legendary: 2% of chance of spawn. 
To see the list of the players go on the file items.json
